# TaxChain Architecture Governance Framework

## Purpose and Scope

This framework establishes the governance structure, processes, and accountabilities for managing the TaxChain enterprise architecture throughout its lifecycle. It ensures architectural decisions align with business objectives while maintaining regulatory compliance and technical integrity.

## Governance Structure

### Architecture Review Board (ARB)
**Chair**: Chief Technology Officer or Enterprise Architect  
**Members**:
- Product Manager (Business Representative)
- Lead Security Architect
- Compliance Officer
- Data Protection Officer
- Representative from Tax Authority (observer)
- Solution Architect (rotating based on domain)

**Meeting Frequency**: Bi-weekly during active development, monthly for maintenance

### Architecture Working Groups
**Blockchain Architecture WG**
- Focus: Blockchain platform decisions, smart contract standards, consensus mechanisms
- Lead: Senior Blockchain Developer

**Integration Architecture WG**
- Focus: ERP integrations, API standards, data exchange protocols
- Lead: Integration Architect

**Security & Compliance WG**
- Focus: Security architecture, regulatory compliance, audit requirements
- Lead: Security Architect

## Decision-Making Authority

### Level 1 - Strategic Architecture Decisions
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Review Board (consensus required)
**Examples**:
- Blockchain platform selection (Hyperledger vs Ethereum)
- Major architectural pattern changes
- Technology stack modifications
- Regulatory framework adoption

**Process**: Formal Architecture Decision Record (ADR) required

### Level 2 - Design Architecture Decisions
**Decision Makers**: Solution Architect + Domain Expert
**Examples**:
- Smart contract design patterns
- API interface specifications
- Database schema changes
- Integration patterns

**Process**: Technical Design Document + peer review

### Level 3 - Implementation Decisions
**Decision Makers**: Development Team Lead
**Examples**:
- Code organization
- Development tools
- Testing approaches
- Deployment configurations

**Process**: Code review + documentation

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

All Level 1 and significant Level 2 decisions must be documented using ADR format:

```
# ADR-001: Blockchain Platform Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need to select blockchain platform for VAT compliance system requiring:
- Permissioned network
- Regulatory compliance features
- Enterprise integration capabilities

## Decision
Adopt Hyperledger Fabric 2.x as primary blockchain platform

## Consequences
Positive:
- Mature permissioning model
- Strong enterprise features
- Regulatory compliance support

Negative:
- Learning curve for team
- Vendor ecosystem limitations

## Compliance Notes
- Meets GDPR privacy requirements
- Supports audit trail requirements
- Compatible with EU tax regulations
```

## Exception Handling Process

### Architecture Variance Request
When implementation needs deviate from approved architecture:

1. **Request Submission**
   - Complete Architecture Variance Form
   - Include business justification
   - Document risk assessment
   - Propose mitigation strategies

2. **Review Process**
   - Technical review by Solution Architect
   - Security review by Security WG
   - Business impact assessment
   - Compliance verification

3. **Decision Timeline**
   - Standard requests: 5 business days
   - Emergency requests: 48 hours
   - Complex requests: 10 business days

4. **Approval Levels**
   - Low risk: Solution Architect
   - Medium risk: ARB subset (3 members)
   - High risk: Full ARB review

### Emergency Architecture Changes
For critical security or compliance issues:

1. **Immediate Implementation** permitted with CTO approval
2. **24-hour notification** to ARB members
3. **Formal review** within 1 week
4. **Retroactive ADR** required within 2 weeks

## Compliance and Audit

### Regular Architecture Reviews
**Quarterly Reviews**:
- Architecture health assessment
- Compliance verification
- Performance metrics review
- Stakeholder feedback integration

**Annual Reviews**:
- Complete architecture assessment
- Strategic alignment validation
- Technology evolution planning
- Governance process improvement

### Compliance Checkpoints
**Pre-Implementation**:
- Security architecture review
- Privacy impact assessment
- Regulatory compliance verification
- Performance baseline establishment

**Post-Implementation**:
- Security penetration testing
- Compliance audit
- Performance validation
- User acceptance confirmation

## Risk Management

### Architecture Risk Categories
**Technical Risks**:
- Platform obsolescence
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance degradation
- Integration failures

**Business Risks**:
- Regulatory changes
- Stakeholder misalignment
- Market conditions
- Competitive threats

**Operational Risks**:
- Skills shortage
- Vendor dependencies
- Infrastructure failures
- Process breakdowns

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Continuous technology assessment
- Multi-vendor strategies
- Regular security audits
- Stakeholder engagement programs
- Skills development initiatives

## Performance Metrics

### Architecture KPIs
**Quality Metrics**:
- Architecture compliance rate (target: >95%)
- Decision implementation time (target: <30 days)
- Exception rate (target: <5%)

**Business Metrics**:
- Regulatory compliance score
- System availability (target: >99.9%)
- Integration success rate
- User satisfaction scores

**Innovation Metrics**:

- Architecture evolution cycles
- Process improvement implementations

## Communication and Reporting

### Stakeholder Communication
**Executive Dashboard**: Monthly architecture health summary
**Business Units**: Quarterly impact reports  
**Development Teams**: Bi-weekly technical updates
**Regulatory Bodies**: As-required compliance reports

### Documentation Requirements
All governance artifacts maintained in:
- Architecture repository (GitHub)
- Decision logs (ADR format)
- Meeting minutes (formal record)
- Compliance reports (audit trail)

## Process Improvement
