# TaxChain Architecture Principles

## Business Principles
1. **Regulatory Compliance First**: All solutions must meet regulatory requirements before optimization
2. **Transparency by Design**: All transactions must be auditable and traceable
3. **Data Sovereignty**: Each jurisdiction maintains control over its tax data

## Data Principles
4. **Immutable Audit Trail**: Once recorded, compliance data cannot be altered
5. **Privacy by Design**: Personal data is protected while maintaining transparency
6. **Single Source of Truth**: One authoritative record for each compliance event

## Application Principles
7. **API-First Design**: All functionality exposed via well-defined APIs
8. **Microservices Architecture**: Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
9. **Cloud Native**: Built for cloud-first deployment and scaling

## Technology Principles
10. **Open Standards**: Use established blockchain and enterprise integration standards
11. **Security by Default**: All communications encrypted, access controlled
12. **Vendor Independence**: Avoid vendor lock-in through abstraction layers
