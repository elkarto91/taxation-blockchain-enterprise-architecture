# Phase C - Information Systems Architecture Summary

## Completed Artifacts âœ“
- [x] Data Architecture with Domain Models and Quality Framework
- [x] Application Architecture with Microservices Design
- [x] Integration Architecture with API Specifications
- [x] Security Architecture with Zero-Trust Implementation

## Key Information Systems Decisions
1. **Data Strategy**: Event sourcing with CQRS, blockchain for immutability
2. **Application Pattern**: Domain-driven microservices with hexagonal architecture  
3. **Integration Approach**: API-first with event-driven patterns
4. **Security Model**: Zero-trust with JWT tokens and service mesh

## Technical Stack Validated
- **Backend Services**: Java 17 (Spring Boot), Node.js 18, Go 1.21
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (operational), MongoDB (documents), Redis (cache)
- **Blockchain**: Hyperledger Fabric with Go/Node.js chaincode
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **Container Platform**: Kubernetes with Istio service mesh

## Performance Targets Established
- API Response Time: <500ms (P95)
- Throughput: 1,000 requests/second per service
- Availability: 99.9% per service
- Data Processing: 10,000 transactions/hour batch processing

## Next Phase: Technology Architecture
Moving to Phase D to define:
- Infrastructure architecture and cloud strategy
- DevOps and deployment pipelines
- Monitoring and observability platforms
- Disaster recovery and business continuity
